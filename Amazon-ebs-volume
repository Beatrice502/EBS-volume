...How to migrate EBS Volume from one AZ to Another 
------------------------------------------------ 
# Case study will be Jenkins Servers 
# Case study will use the t2-micro instance type 
# You can only migrate EBS Volumes from Availability Zone (AZ) to another  
  within the same Region 
# Task: Migrate Jenkins from us-east-2a AZ to us-east-2c 
# Region = Ohio 
# Assuming:- 
  - Jenkins in us-east-2a is the companys existing Jenkins
  - Jenkins in us-east-2c is the new Jenkins the company wants you to migrate 
    their existing Jenkins Server to it. 
  - Jenkins in us-east-2a will be called Jenkins Server 01 
  - Jenkins in us-east-2c will be called Jenkins Server 02  
# cd /var/lib/jenkins = Home directory of jenkins 
# lsblk = List EBS available on the server 
# make sure you are not doing this as root user 


Migration Proper: 
================  

Attach EBS Volume to Server 01
------------------------------

1) Jenkins Server 01:
   ------------------ 
# On Jenkins UAI 
  Install Jenkins and all its plugins  

# Stop Jenkins on the server 
  sudo systemctl stop jenkins 
  sudo systemctl status jenkins

# Add a volume to the Jenkins Server 01 
# On AWS (Create EBS Volume) 
  - Make sure the Jenkins Server Instance is on <stop> state  
  - Select Jenkins Server 01 
  - Elastic Block Store --> Select Volumes --> Create Volume --> Add Tag --> Create Volume 
  # Once Volume is created and <Available>  
  - Select Volume --> Action --> Attach Volume 
  - Make sure its on your AZ --> Select Instance --> Attach 
  - Start your Instance 

# On your Jenkins Server 01 (CLI) 
  - run <lsblk> = to see how many EBS are available  
  - run <sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf> = to format the newly created EBS  
  - Only by formating it can it be ready to receive data   
  - Formatting (or cooking) is creating a file system on the device (EBS) 
      - sudo mkfs = command 
      - .ext4 = the type of file system  
      - /dev/xvdf = EBS mount point (device)  
  - run <sudo file -s /dev/xvdf> = to check if the file system has been created 

  - lsblk = to see the mount point before mounting new EBS  

# Mount the volume to the home of Jenkins 
  - sudo mount /dev/xvdf /var/lib/jenkins  

  - lsblk = to see the mount point after mounting new EBS  

# Make mount point permanent 
  # Make a copy (backup) of the /etc/fstab before you proceed  
    - sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig    
  - sudo blkid = to get the ID of the EBS volume  
  - sudo cat /etc/fstab  
  - vi /etc/fstab    
  - Paste < UUID=(ID) /var/lib/jenkins xfs defaults,nofail 0 2 >
  - Paste the ID of the volume on (ID) 
  - lsblk = to confirm 

# Restart Jenkins  
  - sudo systemctl start jenkins 

# Open Jenkins on browser 
  - First opening will give an error  
# Fix Problem 
  - cd var/lib/jenkins 
  - ls = to check owner (permission) 
  - run <sudo chown jenkins:jenkins -R /var/lib/jenkins = to change ownership  
  - run <sudo service jenkins restart> = to Restart jenkins 


2) Jenkins Server 02:
   ------------------ 
- Once the EBS volume has been created, you can create an image or a snapshot  
- You can now use the snapshot to create another volume which will be like a  
  mirror to the original volume used to create the snapshot  
- Snapshot can be created in different availability zone unlike EBS 

# Install Jenkins on Jenkins Server 02 

# On AWS 
# Create Snapshot
  - Check Jenkins Server 01 and open <Storage> 
  - Select EBS volume --> Action --> Create Snapshot  
    Check <description> and <tag> 
  - Create Snapshot 

# Create Volume from Snapshot 
  - Stop Jenkins Server CLI 
    sudo systemctl stop jenkins 
  - Stop Jenkins Server 02 Instance  
  - Elastic Block Store --> Snapshot --> Action --> Create Volume  
       - Leave Volume Type by <default> 
       - You can increase size but remember once increased cannot be decreased  
       - Make sure you get the correct availability zone  
       - You can chose to either encrypt or not 
       - Add Tag 
       - Create Volume

# Attach Volume to Instance 
 - Select Volume --> Action --> Attach Volume --> 
   Chose Instance --> Attach Volume 

# Start Jenkins Server 02 
 - Start Instance 
 - Make sure Jenkins Server 02 CLI is still in stop state 
    sudo systemctl start jenkins 

# Mount the volume to the home of Jenkins 
  - sudo mount /dev/xvdf /var/lib/jenkins  

  - lsblk = to see the mount point after mounting new EBS  

# Make mount point permanent 
  # Make a copy (backup) of the /etc/fstab before you proceed  
    - cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig    
  - sudo blkid = to get the ID of the EBS volume  
  - sudo cat /etc/fstab  
  - vi /etc/fstab    
  - Paste < UUID=(ID) /var/lib/jenkins xfs defaults,nofail 0 2 
  - Paste the ID of the volume on (ID) 
  - lsblk = to confirm 

# Restart Jenkins  
  - sudo systemctl start jenkins 

# Open Jenkins on browser 
  - First opening will give an error  
# Fix Problem 
  - cd var/lib/jenkins 
  - ls = to check owner (permission) 
  - run <sudo chown jenkins:jenkins -R /var/lib/jenkins = to change ownership  
  - run <sudo service jenkins restart> = to Restart jenkins
